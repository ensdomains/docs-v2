# Subgraph

<WIP />

This is a page covering the graph's ENS subgraph.

## The Graph

The Graph is protocol for indexing and querying data from blockchains. There are multiple subgraphs that you can use to query information about ENS names.
These subgraphs are available for [mainnet](https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/ensdomains/ens) and [goerli](https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/ensdomains/ensgoerli).
