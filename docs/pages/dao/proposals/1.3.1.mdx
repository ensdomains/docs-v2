### Summary

The goal of the Meta-Governance working group (MG WG) is to manage the administration of the ENS DAO. The MG WG shall focus on the following three areas over the Q1/Q2 2022 Term.

1. Treasury Management
2. Governance process and DAO structures
3. DAO Tooling

The following budget is requested to provide the MG WG with the resources to work on the areas mentioned above over the Q1/Q2 2022 Term.

### Proposed Budget

**Elected Steward Compensation (2,700 $ENS)**

* Elected steward compensation: 100 $ENS for each 3 elected stewards / month x 6 months = 1,800 $ENS.
* Lead coordinator compensation, to be paid to the steward that is the lead coordinator or other WG members who take on lead coordinator responsibilities, at the discretion of the Stewards: 150 $ENS / month x 6 months = 900 $ENS

#### Subgroups

**Treasury Management ($20k USDC)**

The MG WG stewards may choose to purchase $ENS with the USDC requested and distribute a mix of USDC and $ENS to contributors as they see fit.
