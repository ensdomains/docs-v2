# Deployments

<Note>
    This page contains information that is only relevant to developers who would
    like to interact with the contract manually. Most libraries will handle this
    for you.
</Note>

Though ENS is a platform-agnostic (read more [here](/learn/multichain)), the ENS Protocol smart-contracts are deployed on Ethereum mainnet, as well as the most popular test-networks, such as goerli, ropsten, rinkeby, and kovan.
Listed below you will find a list of latest deployments of registries, resolvers, and more.
If you are looking for our legacy contracts please refer to the [changelog section](/changelog).

## But what about multichain? {{ tag: "Multichain", title: "Multichain", id: "multichain" }}

The ENS Protocol can be used on/for any chain! If you are building a dApp and want to use ENS you might have to add a [Mainnet RPC to your Wagmi config](/web/libraries).
This allows tools like wagmi to access mainnet, and load ENS information!
