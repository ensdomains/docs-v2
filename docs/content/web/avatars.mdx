# Avatars

Personalization of profiles is what makes identity great.
This page covers the very special **"avatar"** record that enables users to take their avatar with them across the web.

## Getting the users Avatar {{ navtitle: 'User Avatars ', id: 'avatars', tag: 'Avatar' }}

Avatars are an awesome way for users to express themselves. To get the user's avatar, all you need is their **name**. If you only have their address, see [primary names](/web/reverse#get).
The follow code snippets let you get the avatar for a user.

<div className="card px-8 py-4 flex justify-center items-center gap-3 not-prose">
    <span>luc.eth</span>
    <span>‚û°Ô∏è</span>
    <div
        className="w-8 h-8 rounded-full overflow-hidden border"
    >
        <img
            src="https://metadata.ens.domains/mainnet/avatar/luc.eth"
            alt="luc.eth"
            className="w-8 h-8 rounded-full"
        />
    </div>
</div>

<CodeGroup title="Request">

```tsx {{ title: 'Wagmi (React)', language: 'tsx', variant: 'wagmi' }}
import { useEnsAvatar } from 'wagmi';

function App() {
    const { data: ensAvatar } = useEnsAvatar({
        address: 'luc.eth',
        chainId: 1, // (1 = Ethereum Mainnet, 5 = Goerli)
    });

    return (
        <img
            src={ensAvatar || 'https://v3x.space/ens-docs/pfp.webp'}
            alt="luc.eth"
        />
    );
};
```

```ts {{ title: 'Ethers.js (TS)', variant: 'ethers' }}
const ensAvatar = await provider.getAvatar('luc.eth');
```

```ts {{ title: 'Viem (TS)' }}
import { normalize } from 'viem/ens';
import { publicClient } from './client';

const ensAvatar = await publicClient.getEnsAvatar({
    name: normalize('luc.eth'),
});
```

</CodeGroup>

## Supported URI schemas {{ navtitle: 'Supported URI schemas', id: 'uri-schemas', tag: 'URI' }}

ENS avatars support a number of URI schemas, luckily most libraries resolve them for you, so you don't have to worry about them.
The following URI types are supported:

-   `ethereum:` - The default URI scheme for Ethereum addresses
-   `ipfs:` - The default URI scheme for IPFS hashes
-   `bzz:` - The default URI scheme for Swarm hashes
-   `http(s):` - The default URI scheme for HTTP(S) URLs
-   `eip155:` - The default URI scheme for EIP-155 identifiers for linking to NFTs on Ethereum based chains.

<Note>
    For EIP-155 NFT Avatars the nft must be owned by the wallet address the ENS
    name resolves to. This is done by checking the `ownerOf` method on the NFT
    contract.
</Note>

## File Information {{ navtitle: 'File Information', id: 'files', tag: 'Metadata' }}

Avatars come in many different shapes and sizes. Not just the above URI schemas, but also in different file formats, sizes, and more.
Although standards exist for some of these, files are **not required** to follow these standards.

Below is some information that might be nice to have about the avatars your app might be loading.

| What to expect: | Recommendation                                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| File Extension  | Mostly `png`, `jpeg`, `jpg`, `webp`, `gif`, `webm`, but could be anything       |
| File Size       | We recommend having sensible timeouts                                           |
| Aspect Ratio    | We recommend `object-fit: cover` or setting a background color                  |
| Transparancy    | We recommend setting a background color as some images may contain transparancy |

Luckily most browsers and network libraries have default timeouts to start with, we highly recommend that if you are doing any manual avatar downloading or fetching you add a sensible timeout.
