# Resolution

The process by which we load information about a name is called resolution. It's a simple process, but it's important to understand.

<div className="card1 p-4">

</div>

to resolve a name we first fetch the `resolver` of the name.
once we have the resolver we can call it to ask it for say, the `addr` of a name.

we get the result back, show it off in an app, and it works wonders.
