# Resolution

The process by which we load information about a name is called resolution. It's a simple process, but it's important to understand.
Here is a diagram of some of the contracts involved when resolving a name.

## Doing a lookup

Here is a little peak at what happens under the hood of your favourite library when you do a name lookup.

### 1. Find the Resolver

To get the resolver responsible for a name you can query [The Registry](/registry/ens) for the `resolver` of a name.

```
ENS.resolver(bytes32 node) view returns (address)
```

If you would like you can verify it supports the resolver specifications by calling `supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceID)` on the resolver.

### 2. Query the Resolver

Now you have found the resolver responsible for the name in question, you can query it for the information you need.
If the resolver supports text records you can call `text()` to get that text record for the name.
More about loading information from a resolver can be found [here](/resolvers/interacting).
