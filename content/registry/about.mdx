# Why Registries?

Top-Level Domains (TLDs), like `.eth` and `.test`, are owned by smart contracts called <a>registrars</a>, which specify rules governing the allocation of their names.
Anyone may, by following the rules imposed by these registrar contracts, obtain ownership of a domain for their own use.
