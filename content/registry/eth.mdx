The ETH Registrar is a special regisrar. It allows for trustless on-chain name registration and is in charge of the ".eth" TLD.

## Ethereum Layer 1

## Fees

The ETH Registrar charges a fee for registrarion.
This fee is paid in ETH and is set to prevent spamming the registrar.
Any protocol fees are sent to the ENS Treasury.

### 3, 4, and 5 Letter Names

### Pricing Oracle

## ERC721 Spec

In the early days of ENS, 
The original ETH Registrar formed the pre-cursor to the ERC721 standard.
However since XXXX the ETH Registrar now supports the ERC721 standard meaning that 

Users can interact with the ETH Registrar to transfer their name just like with any other ERC721 token.

## Registering a Name

To register a name you can use the [ENS Manager App](https://ens.app/).
If you would like to register a name through a smart contract, or your own interface, you can use the following functions.

### Commit Reveal

The ETHRegistrarController implements a commit reveal scheme to prevent frontrunning.
The way it works is that during the registration process we first call the `commit` function. Wait a few blocks and then call the `register` function.

```solidity
ETHRegistrarController.commit(commitment bytes32)
```

```solidity
ETHRegistrarController.register(name string, owner address, duration uint256, secret bytes32, resolver address, data bytes[], reverseRecord bool, ownerControlledFuses uint16)

// For example
register(
    "myname", // "myname.eth" but only the label
    0x1234..., // The address you want to own the name
    31536000, // 1 year (in seconds)
    0x1234..., // A secret that you have generated (32 bytes)
    0x1234..., // The address of the resolver you want to use
    [],
    false, // Set as primary name?
    0
);
```

If you would like to try registering a name live on a testnet you can use the live demo below.
