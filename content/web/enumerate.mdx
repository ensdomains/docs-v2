# Listing a Users Names

In a fair bit of cases you might want to show off all names that a user has. Due to the nature of how the ENS Protocol works under the hood this might be a slightly more difficult task.
Luckily tooling has been written to accomodate for this and to make it easier.

## Why not all names? {{ title: "Enumeration", id: "enumeration" }}

ENS Resolution ([read more here](/resolution)) relies on smart-contracts & external logic to resolve from name to address.
This means that ahead of time we don't know what names a user has. Notable exceptions include [first-layer](/glossary#first-layer) [.eth names](/registry/eth), and [wrapped names](/subnames/wrapper), these are on-chain, and indexable through scanning events on the appropriate contracts.
Below you will find APIs for querying these names.

## Guidelines

When using one of the methods described below it is generally recommended to allow users to input a name using an [input box](todo-link) and to verify it resolves to the correct address upon user-completion.

The Alchemy platform has provided several endpoints for interacting with ENS names aswell as to query a list of names a user has.

## The Graph {{ title: "The Graph" }}

The ENS Team has worked together closely with the graph to provide the [ENS Subgraph](todo-link). This subgraph indexes ENS name registrations & basic record info for names that are part of the [ETH Registrar]
